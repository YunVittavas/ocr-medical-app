# **OCR for Medical Documents**

## <ins>Overview</ins>

The "OCR for Medical Documents" project is a software application designed to streamline the extraction of text data from medical documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. This tool provides a user-friendly interface for template creation and applies OCR to generate CSV reports, facilitating the efficient analysis of medical documents.

## <ins>Features</ins>

- Template Creation: Easily create templates for different types of medical documents to enhance OCR accuracy.

- OCR Processing: Utilize advanced OCR algorithms to extract text information from medical documents accurately.

- CSV Report Generation: Generate structured CSV reports from the extracted text data for further analysis.
